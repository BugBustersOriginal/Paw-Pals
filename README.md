# Instant Messages

PawPals' instant messaging feature is a crucial part of the app, allowing users to stay connected with their friends and family in real-time. Built using Javascript, React, and MongoDB, the messaging system is fast, efficient, and easy to use.

To implement real-time messaging, PawPals uses sockets, a technology that allows for bidirectional communication between the server and the client. This means that messages are sent and received instantly, without the need to refresh the page.

When a user sends a message, the message is immediately stored in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. This ensures that messages are securely stored and easily accessible to users. The messages are also organized by conversation and messages, making it easy for users to find their chat history with a specific user or group.

Users can also send pictures to one another through the messaging feature. These pictures are securely stored in MongoDB and can be viewed within the conversation thread. Additionally, users will be notified when their picture is viewed and downloaded, allowing them to keep track of who has seen their pet's latest antics.

The messaging feature also includes other useful functionalities such as read receipts, typing indicators, and message notifications. These features help users to stay on top of their conversations and respond quickly to their friends.
